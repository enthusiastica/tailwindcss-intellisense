## Settings

### `tailwindCSS.includeLanguages`

This setting allows you to add additional language support. The key of each entry is the new language ID and the value is any one of the extensions built-in languages, depending on how you want the new language to be treated (e.g. `html`, `css`, or `javascript`):

```json
{
  "tailwindCSS.includeLanguages": {
    "plaintext": "html"
  }
}
```

### `tailwindcss.emmetCompletions`

Enable completions when using [Emmet](https://emmet.io/)-style syntax, for example `div.bg-red-500.uppercase`. **Default: `false`**

```json
{
  "tailwindCSS.emmetCompletions": true
}
```
